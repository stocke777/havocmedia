    "Big influencers look glamorous, but for most small brands, they rarely make sense. Across cities like Delhi, small businesses are increasingly working with micro and local influencers to create content that feels real, costs less, and directly supports website traffic and sales.",

      text: "For a long time, influencer marketing felt out of reach for small businesses. High fees, unclear returns, and short-lived hype made it feel risky. But that perception has changed. Today, small brands are working with micro and local influencers to create authentic content that lives not just on social media, but also on their own websites."

      text: "Instead of chasing millions of followers, businesses are choosing relevance. A local food blogger, a niche fashion creator, or a city-based reviewer often brings more qualified attention than a celebrity account ever could."

      text: "Small influencers usually have a tightly focused audience. Their followers trust them because the content feels personal and relatable. When they talk about a brand, it feels like a recommendation rather than an advertisement."

    {
      type: "paragraph",
      text: "For local businesses, this trust converts better. A Delhi-based influencer talking about a nearby café or service reaches people who can actually become customers, not just viewers."

      text: "One smart shift brands are making is reusing influencer content on their own websites. Reviews, testimonials, product photos, short videos, and blog features created by influencers are being embedded into landing pages and service pages."
    },
    {
      type: "paragraph",
      text: "This does two things. First, it adds social proof to the website. Second, it helps local websites look more alive and trustworthy, especially for first-time visitors who are deciding whether to contact or buy."

      text: "When influencer content is published as blog posts, reviews, or collaborations on a brand’s website, it adds fresh content regularly. This helps with local SEO and keeps the website relevant in search results."
    },
    {
      type: "paragraph",
      text: "Some influencers also link back to the brand’s website from their own blogs or profiles. These backlinks act as trust signals for search engines and slowly improve visibility without aggressive link-building tactics."

      type: "paragraph",
      text: "One of the biggest advantages of working with small influencers is cost control. Many micro-influencers charge anywhere between a few thousand to a few tens of thousands per collaboration, depending on reach and content type."
    },
    {
      type: "paragraph",
      text: "Some are open to barter deals, especially local creators who value long-term partnerships. Compared to paid ads that stop working once the budget runs out, influencer-created content continues delivering value on websites and social platforms."

      type: "paragraph",
      text: "Brands that see the most impact treat influencer collaborations as long-term assets, not one-off posts. A single collaboration can generate reusable content for months, sometimes years."
    },
    {
      type: "paragraph",
      text: "This mindset changes the economics. Instead of paying for temporary visibility, businesses invest in content that strengthens their brand presence, improves website credibility, and supports multiple marketing channels."

    {
      type: "paragraph",
      text: "For local businesses, this feedback loop is invaluable. It’s like having a focus group that also creates content and brings customers."

      text: "For local websites and small brands, this approach fits perfectly. Lower risk, better targeting, and content that continues to work long after the campaign ends."
