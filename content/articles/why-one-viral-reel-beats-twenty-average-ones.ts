  excerpt:
    "This might sound unfair, but on social media one viral reel can outperform months of consistent posting. Not because you didn’t work hard, but because platforms reward spikes, not averages. Once you understand this, a lot of frustration suddenly makes sense.",

      text: "Let me say this plainly, because nobody likes to admit it. On platforms like Instagram, one viral reel is worth more than 20 normal ones combined. And no, this doesn’t mean consistency is useless. It just means reach is brutally uneven."

      type: "paragraph",
      text: "Meanwhile, 20 decent reels might reach only your existing audience and then quietly die. Same effort. Completely different outcomes."

    {
      type: "paragraph",
      text: "One viral reel can cross 500k, 1M, or even more. That’s not double or triple. That’s 10x to 50x the reach of everything you posted combined."
