    "If you’ve ever wondered why Instagram feels exhausting while YouTube feels slow but meaningful, you’re not imagining things. These platforms are built very differently, and understanding that difference can save you a lot of time, energy, and frustration.",

      text: "Let me explain this like I would to a friend over chai. YouTube and Instagram are both called social media, but they behave like completely different creatures. If you use them the same way, one of them will always feel disappointing. The trick is understanding what each platform actually rewards."

      type: "paragraph",
      text: "Instagram is fast, emotional, and noisy. YouTube is slow, logical, and patient. Neither is better by default, but they serve very different purposes, especially if you’re trying to grow something long-term."

      type: "paragraph",
      text: "Instagram runs on dopamine. Reels, likes, views, sudden spikes, sudden drops. One reel can blow up randomly and the next ten can completely die. That’s normal. The platform is built for discovery and entertainment, not stability."
    },
    {
      type: "paragraph",
      text: "This makes Instagram feel exciting but also mentally draining. You keep checking numbers. You start chasing trends. You feel like you’re doing something wrong when reach drops, even though nothing actually changed."

    },
    {
      type: "paragraph",
      text: "A YouTube video might get very few views in the first week, but if it’s useful, it can keep getting views for months or even years. That alone changes how you should think about effort."

      type: "paragraph",
      text: "Let’s talk honestly. Instagram content is quicker to make but dies fast. A reel usually lives for 24 to 72 hours. After that, it’s basically gone unless it goes viral."
    },
    {
      type: "paragraph",
      text: "YouTube content takes more effort, but it lives longer. One good video can outperform 50 reels over time. That’s why YouTube feels slow in the beginning but powerful later."

      type: "paragraph",
      text: "Instagram constantly pushes you to post more. Stories every day. Reels daily. Trends weekly. Miss a few days and your reach drops. This creates a sense of urgency that never ends."

    {
      type: "paragraph",
      text: "Over time, creators burn out not because content is hard, but because the platform never lets you rest. You feel invisible the moment you stop posting."

    },
    {
      type: "paragraph",
      text: "YouTube doesn’t punish you as harshly for taking breaks. If your video is good, it will still get picked up later. This makes YouTube feel more fair, even though growth is slower."

    {
      type: "paragraph",
      text: "It also forces you to think clearly. Titles, thumbnails, structure, value. You can’t fake it for long."

      type: "paragraph",
      text: "This is why YouTube audiences convert better for courses, services, or long-form content. Instagram is great for visibility, but not always depth."

    {
      type: "paragraph",
      text: "The smartest approach is using Instagram as a discovery layer and YouTube as the foundation. But if you’re short on time or energy, choosing one intentionally is better than doing both badly."
