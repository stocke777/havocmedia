  excerpt:
    "If YouTube feels more annoying, more ad-heavy, and less creator-friendly than it used to, you’re not imagining it. This is a classic platform cycle where users get hooked, creators get dependent, and eventually the platform tightens control to extract maximum money.",

      text: "People call this enshitification, but all it really means is this: first the platform is nice to users, then it’s nice to creators, and finally it’s nice only to itself."
