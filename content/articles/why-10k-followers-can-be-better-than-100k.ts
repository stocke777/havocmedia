    "Everyone chases follower count, but in reality a small, focused audience often beats a massive, random one. Depending on your niche and what you’re selling, 10,000 right people can easily outperform 100,000 wrong ones.",

      text: "Let’s kill the biggest social media myth first. More followers does not automatically mean more money, more impact, or more success. It just looks good on a profile. In many cases, especially with ads and niche content, 10k followers can outperform 100k by a huge margin."

      text: "A niche page with 10k followers usually attracts people for a very specific reason. That intent matters more than raw numbers."
